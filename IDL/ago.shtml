				<TD>AgoMLT</TD>
				<TD>Returns a structure filled with hordes of data products organized
					by MLT in seconds for simple time domain data products and in 24 independent
					1-hr MLT bins for spectral data products. 
					Simply set the start and final dates and which site. 
					(Dependencies: agoMltDay, agoMltDays, ...)

				<TD>AgoMltDay</TD>
				<TD>This program actually does all the hard work for AgoMlt and AgoMltDays. That
					is, this program computes all the various data products I frequently work with 
					as a function of MLT for a given day. It loads in two UT days such that it can
					compute spectral data products for 24 1-hr MLT bins centered, each centered on
					the beginning of the hour, e.g., the bin for 0300 is the clopen interval [0230,0330).
					AgoMltDays simply wraps over AgoMltDay and collates the data products into daily columns
					(i.e., returns NDayxN matrices, where N is number of elements in data product), 
					whereas AgoMlt wraps over AgoMltDays in order to return NDayxN vectors. AgoMlt is
					more useful when wanting to plot multi-day spans of a data product, where AgoMltDays
					is useful when you want to compute MLT statistics for the 24 independent 1-hr 
					bins.
