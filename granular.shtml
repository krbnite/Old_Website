		<p>Why is granular flow a hot topic? It's a matter of categorization, really: from a pragmatic, engineering standpoint, things like solids and fluids are relatively understood. But what about substances that behave both like solids and fluids? <a href="https://youtu.be/51C7vEAVbxk?t=1m10s">Mudslides</a>, <a href="https://youtu.be/IlzT6VjXw-E?t=2s">avalanches</a>, <a href="https://youtu.be/ouAUo9jVtAU?t=2m6s">vibrating sand</a>!

					Analysis, simulation and visualization of 1D tapping via reduced dynamical models</a></p>
				<p><u>Abstract</u>: A low-dimensional center-of-mass dynamical model is devised as a simplified 
				means of approximately predicting some important aspects of the motion of a vertical column comprised
			 	of a large number of particles subjected to gravity and periodic vertical tapping. This model is 
				investigated first as a continuous dynamical system using analytical, simulation and visualization 
				techniques. Then, by employing an approach analogous to that used to approximate the dynamics of a 
				bouncing ball on an oscillating flat plate, it is modeled as a discrete dynamical system and analyzed
			 	to determine bifurcations and transitions to chaotic motion along with other properties. The predictions
			 	of the analysis are then compared--primarily qualitatively--with visualization and simulation results of 
				the reduced continuous model, and ultimately with simulations of the complete system dynamics.</p>

					Dynamical systems model and discrete element simulations of a tapped granular
					column</a></p>
				<p><u>Abstract</u>: We present an approximate dynamical systems model for the mass center trajectory 
				of a tapped column of N uniform, inelastic, spheres (diameter d), in which collisional energy loss 
				is governed by the Walton-Braun linear loading-unloading soft interaction. Rigorous analysis of the model, 
				akin to the equations for the motion of a single bouncing ball on a vibrating plate, reveals a parameter 
				$$\gamma = 2a\omega^{2}(1+e)/g$$ that gauges the dynamical regimes and their transitions. 
				In particular, we find bifurcations
				from periodic to chaotic dynamics that depend on frequency \(\omega\), amplitude a/d of the tap. Dynamics predicted 
				by the model are also qualitatively observed in discrete element simulations carried out over a broad range 
				of the tap parameters.</p>

					Integrability analysis of regular and fractional Blackmore-Samulyak-Rosato fields</a></p>
				<p><u>Abstract</u>: Blackmore-Samulyak-Rosato (BSR) fields, originally developed as a 
				means of obtaining reliable continuum approximations for granular flow dynamics in terms of 
				relatively simple integro-differential equations, can be used to model a wide range of physical 
				phenomena. Owing to results obtained for one-dimensional granular flow configurations, it has 
				been conjectured that BSR models of fields with perfectly elastic interactions are completely 
				integrable infinite-dimensional Hamiltonian systems. This conjecture is proved for BSR models 
				in one space dimension, and analogues of BSR fields involving fractional time derivatives are 
				briefly investigated.</p>

				Tapping Dynamics of a Column of Particles and Beyond</a></p>
			<p><u>Abstract</u>: The dynamics of a vertical stack of particles subject to gravity and a sequence of small, 
			periodically applied taps is considered. First, the motion of the particles, assumed to be identical,
		 	is modeled as a system of ordinary differential equations, which is analyzed with an eye to observing 
			connections with finite-dimensional Hamiltonian systems. Then, two approaches to obtaining approximate
		 	continuum models for large numbers of particles are described: the long-wave approximation that yields 
			partial differential equations and the BSR method that employs integro-partial differential models. These 
			approximate continuum models, which comprise infinite-dimensional dynamical systems, are studied with a 
			focus on nonlinear wave type behavior, which naturally leads to investigating links to infinite-dimensional
		 	Hamiltonian systems. Several examples are solved numerically to show similarities among the solution properties
		 	of the finite-dimensional (lattice-dynamics), and the approximate long-wave and BSR continuum models. 
			Extensions to higher dimensions and more general dynamically driven particle configurations are also sketched.

					<td width="450">This was the coolest contour image I produced! Look at the breath-taking structure. But alas, the equations I used to model the finite difference computations off of had a few things very unphysical about them. Since it didn't make it to the paper, I figured it would make it to my website :-p
