					Locating the open-closed boundary during the passage of a corotating interaction region</a></p>
				<p><u>Abstract</u>: During the 2007-2009 solar quiet period there existed a unique opportunity to study 
				the synoptic variability of the open-closed boundary (OCB) using data provided by fluxgate magnetometers
			 	located at South Pole, McMurdo, and from a network of Automatic Geophysical Observatories distributed 
				across the Antarctic continent. In Urban et al [2011], this synoptic variability was analyzed during a 
				geomagnetic quiet period of early August 2008 and excellent (>83%) agreement was found between the 
				experimental observations and the BATSRUS space weather model. In this paper we discuss the OCB's synoptic 
				behavior under the forcing of a geomagnetic storm driven by a corotating interaction region and again compare
			 	these results to predictions made with different versions of BATSRUS model runs. Strictly adhering to the 
				method developed in Urban et al [2011], we show only weak agreement between the experimental data and model 
				during this geomagnetically-active time, independent of the model resolution and the incorporation of the 
				Rice Convection Model. Given that a potential source of disagreement could be from the rigidity of the 
				original open/closed field line determination technique itself (developed for geomagnetic quiescence), we 
				adapt the technique to variations in local time and geomagnetic activity; any remaining discrepancies 
				between the data and the model are investigated with DMSP spacecraft-determined boundary data.</p>

					Modulation of Ring Current He-Ions by Bounce-Resonant ULF Waves</a></p>
				<p><u>Abstract</u>: The Radiation Belt Storm Probe Ion Composition Experiment (RBSPICE) 
				instrument on the Van Allan Probes makes unique measurements of, among other ring current species, 
				He-ions in the 65-keV to 520-keV energy range. In this paper we report the spatial and temporal 
				variability of the high L-shell, low energy He-ion phase-space densities (PSD), as measured on both 
				spacecraft during non-storm intervals. We find that the He-ion PSD at these locations and energies 
				change dramatically from orbit to orbit across similar regions of the magnetosphere, and this 
				variability is often related to simultaneously-observed variability in H-ion PSD (also at high 
				L-shell and low energy). We show that the hourly modulation of both species is highly correlated to 
				Pc1 and Pc3 wave activity. Specifically, we conclude that Pc3 frequency bounce-resonant ULF waves 
				are responsible for scattering of He-ions, and thus control the non-storm morphology of ring current 
				He-ions.</p>

					Solar wind-driven ULF activity in Earth's inner radiation belt: Effects on trapped electrons</a></p>
				<p><u>Abstract</u>: We report that, before and during multi-banded energetic electron events observed at 
				near-equatorial, low L-values in the Van Allen Probes RBSPICE electron flux data, ULF power is distributed 
				quasi-uniformly across broad ULF ranges (e.g., 9-20 minutes) for hours at a time. Data are used from 40+ 
				conjugate ground-based magnetometers within the L-shell range [1-2]. This finding of geomagnetic power levels
			 	is in contrast to previous conclusions from low Earth-orbit DEMETER spacecraft data that similar trapped 
				particle structures result from power distributed quasi-monochromatically at some central period within this 
				band. Though modeling results associated with previous claims reproduce the multi-band energy structure in the 
				simulated electron flux data, the model hinges on the existence of a sole monochromatic wave whose power is 
				distributed over a range of azimuthal wave numbers. Given that we find the magnetometer data from many sites 
				to have power distributed quasi-uniformly over a broad ULF range, we note that it's possible to isolate a 
				"quasi-monochromatic" ULF wave of one's choosing from such a spectrum given the right choice of a filter. 
				We also show that the ribbed energy structures in the RBSPICE electron fluxes are highly associated with 
				the Kp Index and solar wind data; specifically, the structures seem to be associated with the speed of the 
				solar wind, and therefore with the passage of interplanetary structures past Earth.

					Particle precipitation regimes of the polar cap in the midst of deep 
					geomagnetic quiescence: perspectives from the AGO magnetometer network</a></p>
				<p><u>Abstract</u>: In Urban et al [2011], a scheme was devised to synoptically monitor the open-closed 
				boundary [OCB] by employing magnetic field data from the AGO network of fluxgate magnetometers across 
				the Antarctic plateau. For each magnetometer in the network, the scheme was designed to decide 
				whether or not the instrument was sampling an open or closed magnetic field line at 10-minute temporal 
				resolution. To verify the scheme, the data product was compared to BATSRUS output during a quiet interval in 
				2008 preceding the passage of a corotating interaction region [CIR]. Although the comparison was favorable 
				during the quiescent period, there remains an inherent ambiguity involved in using a model to verify the 
				approach. This current study aims to directly compare the results of our OCB detection scheme with particle 
				precipitation data as measured by DMSP satellites. The quietest periods during the unusually quiet 2008-2009 
				timespan are investigated to expose possible relationships between certain OCB signatures in the magnetometer 
				data and the various particle regimes as defined by well-documented particle precipitation methods.</p>

				Quiet-time observations of the open-closed boundary prior to the CIR-induced
				storm of 9 August 2008</a>
			<p><u>Abstract</u>: The open-closed magnetic field line boundary (OCB) is an important indicator 
			of magnetospheric dynamics and can be used to identify locations of particle precipitation at the 
			edge of the magnetosphere. The OCB can fluctuate during geomagnetic events, and the extent of this 
			variability is a vital component of space weather research and modeling. There was a unique opportunity
		 	to identify and study the synoptic variability of the OCB during the extended 2007¿2009 solar quiet 
			period through use of the Polar Experiment Network for Geophysical Upper-atmosphere Investigations¿Automatic 
			Geophysical Observatory (PENGUIn-AGO) network of ground-based fluxgate magnetometers on the Antarctic continent. 
			The fluxgates, which measured the occurrence of standing Pc5 modes on closed field magnetic field lines,
		 	allowed for identification of the OCB structure and study of the synoptic behavior of the OCB before and 
			during a corotating interaction region (CIR)-driven magnetic storm. Observations were compared with results 
			from the BATSRUS space weather model and show 83% agreement for over ¿2 days before the CIR event. It is shown
		 	that such synoptic magnetometer data sets of the OCB during these storms allow for a careful test of current 
			space weather models. The current study investigates the pre¿storm time period, while a future paper 
			will address the storm time evolution of the OCB.</p>

				Synoptic-scale magnetometer observations of the open-closed field line boundary</a></p>
			<p><u>Abstract</u>: The open-closed field line boundary (OCB) of Earth's magnetosphere can be utilized as a 
			window into the global state of the magnetospheric system. During various geomagnetic events, the OCB can 
			vary in both size and shape; the extent of this variability is a vital component of space weather research 
			and modeling. During the 2007-2009 solar quiet period there was a unique opportunity to identify and study the 
			synoptic variability of the OCB during such events through use of the Polar Experiment Network for Geophysical 
			Upper-atmosphere Investigations-Automatic Geophysical Observatory (PENGUIn-AGO) network of ground-based 
			fluxgate magnetometers on the Antarctic continent. The magnetometers, spanning a range of latitudes and local 
			times, measure the occurrence of standing Pc5 modes on closed magnetic field lines, as well as a long period 
			band indicative of closed field lines extending into the magnetotail. Synthesis of this information can 
			lead to isolating the structure and dynamics of the OCB, for example, before and during the passage of a 
			co-rotating interaction region (CIR) or coronal mass ejection (CME). Observations were compared with results 
			from the BATSRUS space weather model and show 83% agreement during geomagnetic quiescence. The model and 
			the data differ during a geomagnetic storm driven by a CIR. Discrepancies between the data and the model 
			are currently being investigated.</p>

				Solar p-mode frequency plasma waves in high speed solar wind streams</a></p>
			<p><u>Abstract</u>: We report our finding that discrete plasma wave frequencies in the 3-20
		 	minute period band (solar p-mode frequencies) are concentrated in high speed solar wind 
			streams originating from solar coronal holes. The results are based on analysis of solar 
			wind proton velocities measured by the SWEPAM (Solar Wind Electron, Proton, and Alpha Monitor)
		 	instrument on board the ACE (Advanced Composition Explorer) satellite. The analysis spans several 
			solar rotations (CIR events) during the quiet sun period of June through August 2008, when 
			CME and other transient solar-produced events were absent. Waves in the solar wind plasma 
			may carry signatures of the Sun's interior structure, and dynamics in the chromosphere and corona. 
			This finding adds important new insights to past findings that solar p-mode frequencies propagate as 
			plasma waves into the interplanetary medium. The dominance of such waves in the high speed streams 
			implies that the open field lines from solar polar coronal holes provide a key path for the waves to 
			propagate to large distances from the Sun.</p>
