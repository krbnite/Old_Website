At the Center for Solar-Terrestrial Research, I have investigated various issues under the 
umbrella of "space weather." Most of my research has been concerned with how to characterize the 
state of the magnetosphere via knowledge of its open-closed boundary (OCB)---that is, the boundary 
between lower-latitude closed terrestrial field lines and field lines in the polar cap regions that 
have been reconnected to the interplanetary magnetic field (IMF). During geomagnetic events, the 
OCB can vary in both size and shape; the extent of this variability is a vital component of space 
weather research and modeling.</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c3">
In order to monitor the OCB and study the magnetosphere, I utilize large data sets gathered at 1-Hz 
by a high-latitude network of fluxgate magnetometers. Lanzerotti et al [1999] demonstrated that 
spectral analysis of a fluxgate's data (on the dayside) yields information specifying when/if the 
OCB crossed the fluxgate. My work has been to extend this analysis to the nightside 
and ultimately develop a scheme that continuously determines if the fluxgate is equatorward of, poleward of, or on
the OCB. By employing a strategically-designed network topology spanning a range of high geomagnetic latitudes
and magnetic local times, in this way we are able to isolate the structure and dynamics of the OCB before and during various
geomagnetic conditions, such as during the passage co-rotating interaction region (CIR) or coronal mass
ejection (CME).

<p class="c2"><span class="c1">2008 - Present</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c3">
Dr. Blackmore and I are currently investigating topics in fractional calculus and fractional 
differential equations with an eye towards applications to field theories in physics. We hope to 
finish up significant portions of our investigations over the coming months and are working towards 
publishing these results before I leave for my PhD studies.</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c3">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c3">
Presently, I have authored two papers with Dr. Blackmore, one of which is now in press in the 
Journal of Mechanics of Materials and Structures and another which has been submitted Condensed 
Matter Physics. The paper in press is the first of many in an ongoing investigation into the 
dynamical behavior of &nbsp;various configurations of granular particles subject to gravity and a 
sequence of small, periodically applied taps using an approximate continuum model developed by Dr. 
Blackmore in previous work. This model, which comprises an in&#64257;nite-dimensional dynamical 
system and is now known as a BSR field, is studied with a focus on nonlinear wave type behavior. 
Tying together our work on granular flow dynamics and fractional field theories, we will be looking 
into fractionalized versions of the BSR field. The paper submitted to Condensed Matter Physics 
(&ldquo;Integrability Analysis of Regular and Fractional BSR Fields&rdquo;) is our first step in 
this direction. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="c2"><span class="c3">
High above the earth&rsquo;s lower and middle atmosphere there exists a spread of dynamical 
conditions characterizing what has become known as space weather. In the manner that 
&ldquo;weather&rdquo; refers to the evolving state of the troposphere, the phrase &ldquo;space 
weather&rdquo; denotes the state of the near-space environment&mdash;often referred to as 
geospace&mdash;which includes the ionosphere and magnetosphere. Depending on context, space weather 
also refers to the state of the earthward flowing solar wind and conditions at the surface of the 
sun. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c3">A corotating interaction region (CIR) is a distinct type of solar 
wind configuration and one of the primary drivers of space weather. When a CIR crosses paths with 
the earth&rsquo;s magnetosphere, inherent Alfvenic structures within it cause the magnetosphere to 
undergo vigorous oscillations and deformations. During most phases of solar activity there is little 
hope in isolating the exact nature of this interaction. Fortunately, the year 2008 marked a 
historically quiet period of solar activity. Dr. Andrew Gerrard and I took this opportunity to 
clearly distinguish the spectral signature of the CIR and isolate its impact on the magnetosphere 
by using the PENGUIn AGOs network of ground-based magnetometers on the Antarctic continent; the 
data was subsequently analyzed using a host of programs/techniques developed in both MATLab and 
IDL.</span></p>

<p class="c2"><span class="c3">As an undergraduate working for Dr. Gerrard, much of my time was dedicated familiarizing myself with geomagnetism, plasma physics, the magnetosphere, and the solar-terrestrial interaction. It was also a time of developing my programming skills in languages such as MATLab, IDL, and Unix. More importantly, I managed and helped initiate the geomagnetism research efforts for Dr. Gerrard and the Center for Solar-Terrestrial Research. This came in many forms including assisting in the installation of a fluxgate magnetometer in Jenny Jump State Forrest in Hope, NJ; interfacing our instrument with an on-site computer; and developing public outreach efforts, such as public lectures and educational materials for the astronomy museum at Jenny Jump (e.g., a real-time graphical display of the magnetometer data being recorded nearby and two posters describing the geomagnetic field, the fluxgate magnetometer, and a brief history of magnetism).</span></p>

<p class="c2"><span class="c3">My team developed a proposal for an instrument to measure the polarization pattern and black body spectrum of the cosmic microwave background and thereby test the predictions of inflationary physics. Specifically, the instrument was designed to detect a unique signal produced by theoretical gravity waves that are predicted to have been excited during the proposed inflationary epoch. I programmed simulations concerned with how the instrument would collect and interpret data while in orbit and revolving about its own axis.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3">&nbsp;</span></p>
