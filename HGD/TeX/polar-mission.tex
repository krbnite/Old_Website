\textbf{Discuss the role and function of POLAR, CRRES, and FAST spacecraft.}

POLAR was designed to study the polar magnetosphere carefully as a
function of altitude. 

The FAST satellite \citep{McComas1998} was designed to investigate
particle acceleration processes and other phenomena related to the aurora by
taking high-resolution snapshots (both spatially and temporally) when
passing over Earth's auroral zones. It was the second mission in 
NASA's Small Explorer (SMEX) program --- a program with the philosophy
and intention of fostering
highly focused space missions in such a way that the science strategy
and engineering design could be integrated and optimized allowing for
cheaper, but (hopefully) novel designs that allowed for great science on
relatively small budget relatively cheap compared to
fuller size space missions (were SMEX missions a precursor to
CubeSats?). The synergy of the instrumentation and the spacecraft's design made for
an unprecedented capacity for continuous particle and field data
colletion, ultimately defining a new standard for how auroral space
missions (and related missions) could be implemented. 

The Combine Release and Radiation Effects Satellite (CRRES) used a
geosynchronous transfer orbit (GTO) to---amongst other things---study the inner and outer
radiation belts and how they affect microelectronic devices. Another
topic under investigation was the chemical release study, which released
chemicals near dawn and dusk at low altitudes and near local midnight at
high altitudes; the chemical releases were then monitored by
ground-based instrumentation to investigate photo-ionization and plasma
motion.
