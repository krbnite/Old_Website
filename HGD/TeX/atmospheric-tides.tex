\textbf{What are the restoring forces for atmospheric tides, planetary
waves, and gravity waves, respectively?}

From Aeronomy of the Earth's Atmosphere and Ionosphere:
"The restoring force that acts on atmospheric tides is gravity, so tides
are a special class of gravity waves, which are affected by the Earth's
rotation and sphericity because of their global scales."

"Planetary waves are global-scale oscillations that exist due to Earth's
rotation and the conservation of absolute vorticity. The restoring force
for a planetary wave oscillation is ultimately the poleward gradient of
the planetary vorticity."

And for gravity waves: well, gravity is the restoring force!
