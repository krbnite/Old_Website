* what is it?

Hargreeves [1969] says that the Sen-Wyller formulation of ionospheric
absorption requires a computer, but that since the absorption is
proportional to the electron density, it is possible to work in terms of
a "specific absorption" which need be only computed once for a given
frequency and a given collision frequency profile

1962: Webber: The production of free electrons in the ionospheric D
layer by solar and galactic cosmic rays and the resultant absorption of
radio waves
1964: Little: Extension of cosmic noise absorption measurements to lower
frequencies using polarized antennas
