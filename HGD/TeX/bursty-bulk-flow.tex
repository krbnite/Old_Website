\textbf{What is a BBF? Why are they considered to be "hot topics" in
magnetospheric research?}

One hypothesis (e.g., Burke 2000) states that bursty bulk flows (BBF)
are accelerated at near-Earth neutral lines. The name, BBF, describes
brief measurements (typically on the order of a minute or two) made by
spacecraft in the magnetotail of rapidly Earthward-moving (~100+ km/s) structures
in the plasma sheet. These are hot topics because some consider BBFs to
be an elementary component of a substorm, although not all are
associated with substorms -- why? Particularly, they seem associated
with substorm onsets. But what causes them? If they are so associated
with substorm onset, then how can they sometimes occur independent of
any registered substorm?
