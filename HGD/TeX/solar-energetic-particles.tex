\textbf{What is a SEP? What are some theories of energization?}

A SEP is a "solar energetic particle": a high-energy particle of solar
origin. SEP species include protons, electrons, and heavier ions, i.e.,
solar energetic particles might better be called solar energetic ions
(in that they're not neutral particles and they're not sub-atomic
particles). 

Side note: In the literature one often reads about solar particle events, or SPEs:
SPEs are events associated with SEPs. One might even see the two terms
used interchangeably from time to time, although technically speaking, a
SEP refers to an energized particle, the type of which make up a SPE.

SEPs are accelerated to near-relativistic speeds by interplanetary shock
waves preceding coronal mass ejections and those found in the vicinity
of solar flares. One theory of energization is called "diffusive shock
acceleration," which is a type of Fermi acceleration; this type of
mechanism describes the acceleration that a charged particle experiences
while undergoing repeated reflections in a magnetic mirror geometry
associated with shock waves.
