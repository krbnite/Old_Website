X: in direction of the spacecraft nadir (radially down, I believe)
Y: points along the spacecraft's velocity vector
Z: completes the right-handed system


So, if you were the spacecraft, flying like Super Man (that is, like
this:  >--<o), then X would be straight ahead, Y would be down, and Z
would be into the page.
