\textbf{Calculate the change in magnetopause stand-off distance if the
solar wind goes from 300 to 700 km/s.}

The basic equation given for this is found in lecture 9:

\begin{gather*}
  R_{mp} =
  \left(\frac{KB_{E}^{2}}{2\mu_{0}m_{p}n_{sw}u_{sw}^{2}}\right)^{\frac{1}{6}}
\end{gather*}

If we keep all parameters constants except for the solar wind speed, we
can find the ratio of the magnetopause stand-off distance for the two
speeds.

\begin{gather*}
  \frac{R_{mp}(u=300)}{R_{mp}(u=700)} = (7/3)^{1/3} = 1.33
\end{gather*}

So the stand-off distance of the magnetopause for the 300 [km/s] solar
wind is 1.33 times further from the Earth than the stand-off distance
for the faster (700 [km/s]) solar wind. 

That is, if at 300 [km/s], the magnetospause stand-off distance was 10
[RE], then when the speed quickens to 700 [km/s], the stand-off distance
will shorten to about 7.5 [RE], assuming all other parameters remain
roughly constant.
