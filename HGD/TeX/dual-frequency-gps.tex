\textbf{What are the typical frequencies used for ``dual frequency''
GPS?}

The two frequencies typically utilized are:
1575.42 MHz (called L1) and 1227.60 MHz (called L2). 

The benefit of using two frequencies rather than one is that corrections
for ionospheric delay errors can be made directly from the data instead
of relying too heavily on a model.
