Note: for a more complete run down of ionospheric absorption of radio
waves, see the corresponding entry, which gives basic overview and
descriptions of mid-to-low and high-latitude categories of ionospheric
absorption. This article discusses auroral absorption [AA], which is one
type of high-latitude ionospheric radio wave absorption.
