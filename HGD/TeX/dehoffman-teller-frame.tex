\textbf{For MHD shock waves, why is $\left[\vec{u_{t}}\right] ||
\left[\vec{B_{t}}\right]$?}

I'm not sure if this is true for all frames, but for the
deHoffman-Teller frame it is.

The dHT frame is defined such that $\left| \vec{u_{1}} \times
\vec{B_{1}}\right| =
0$. From the Rankine-Hugoniot relations for MHD, we can then immediately
write down $\left| \vec{u_{2}} \times \vec{B_{2}}\right| = 0$.

By property of the cross product, what we've just said is that in the
dHT frame, the magnetic field and the plasma flow are parallel to each
other in both regions delimited by the shock --- that is, the upstream
magnetic field is parallel to the upstream flow and the downstream
magnetic field is parallel to the downstream flow.

Since the two quantities are parallel in both domains they are found in, we
need only consider the unit vectors, $\vec{d_{1}}$ and $\vec{d_{2}}$,
associated with the directions of these quantities in each domain.

From here, it is obvious that the relationship $\left[\vec{u_{t}}\right] ||
\left[\vec{B_{t}}\right]$ holds. Simply rewrite each quantity in terms
of it's (unitless) unit vector, $\vec{d}$.
\begin{center}
\begin{math}
  \left[ \vec{B} \right] = \left[ \vec{B_{t}} + \vec{B_{n}} \right] ||
  \left[ \vec{d_{t}} + \vec{d_{n}} \right] || \left[
  \vec{u_{t}}+\vec{u_{n}} \right] = \left[ \vec{u} \right]
\end{math}
\end{center}

The relationship is hidden in there, but it's there:
\begin{center}
  \begin{math}
    \left[ \vec{B_{t}} \right] || \left[ \vec{d_{t}} \right] || \left[
    \vec{u_{t}} \right]
  \end{math}
\end{center}
