\textbf{Why is the stratosphere so stable (i.e., why is the wind flow so
steady)? what causes this stability?}

Temperature rises with altitude, and thus there is no significant
convective motion and mixing. This means that, at least to a low-order
approximation, there is almost no vertical exchange of mass and
momentum, thus nice, stable, steady wind flow and a stable stratosphere.
