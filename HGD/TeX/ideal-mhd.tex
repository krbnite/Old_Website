\textbf{What is the difference between ideal MHD and Hall MHD?}

Ideal MHD throws away a lot of possibly important information. For
starters, it throws away the displacement current term in Maxwell's
equations. It also treats the ions and the electrons as a single
fluid. 

The main difference with respect to Hall MHD has to do with Ohm's law.
In IMHD, it corresponds to the equation:

\begin{math}
  \vec{E} + \vec{V}\times\vec{B} = 0
\end{math}

Hall MHD places more importance on the electric field then does ideal
MHD, and incorporates the Hall current term in Ohm's Law:

$ \vec{E} + \vec{V}\times\vec{B} = \frac{1}{ne}\vec{J}\times\vec{B} $
