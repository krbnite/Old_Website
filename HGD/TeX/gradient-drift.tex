The gradient drift velocity of an energetic ion is:
$\vec{V}_{G} = \frac{\mu_{i}}{qB^{2}}\vec{B}\times\nabla B$,
where $\mu_{i}$ is the ion's magnetic moment, a constant of the motion
(adiabatic invariant).
-- in a dipole model, B is proportional to $R^{-3}$, where R is the distance
to the center of the Earth, and so $\vec{V}_{G}$ is proportional to $R^{-1}$.


$V_{G} = |\vec{V}_{G}| = \frac{\mu_{i}|\nabla{B}|sin(\vec{B},\nabla{B})}{qB}
 -- Cheryl Hunag [2004] says this turns out to be equal to:
V_{G}=R\frac{d\phi}{dt}, and says this means that the rate at which energetic
ions drift in local time to the west is proprtional to $R^{-2}$.
