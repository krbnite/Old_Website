\textbf{What is the biggest challenge to the weather forecasting
community in making accurate 4-day (and longer) forecasts?}

General Circulation Models still do not properly address gravity waves
and, often, due to the inherent spatial resolution of the model, they
cannot even resolve gravity wave dynamics. To remedy this, gravity wave
parameterizations are implemented, but since the full spectrum of
gravity wave sources is not fully understood, such method have obvious
inherent weaknesses. Since the GCMs cannot fully account for gravity
waves, the associated uncertainty becomes unwieldy. As computing power
progresses, we may get better forecasts by replacing ad hoc GW
parametrizations with spatial resolution that allows for the dynamics of
gravity waves to be resolved from the basic equations of the model.
