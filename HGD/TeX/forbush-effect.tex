\textbf{Summarize the impacts of the Forbush Effect}

In 1937, Scott E. Forbush observed that the intensity of cosmic rays as
measured at Earth was anti-correlated with the solar sunspot cycle. The
effect is thougt to be due to a magnetic shielding affect associated
with the interplanetary propagation of solar storms out into the
heliosphere (i.e., flares and
coronal mass ejections). The Forbush effect, as it is now known, is
responsible for blocking cosmic rays from penetrating too deeply into
the heliosphere during times surrounding solar
maximum; during times surrounding solar minimum, due to the lack of
strong solar activity controlling the make-up of the solar wind, cosmic
rays are able to reach deep within the heliosphere, as evidenced by
measurements near and at Earth.
