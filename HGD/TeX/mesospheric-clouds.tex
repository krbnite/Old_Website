\textbf{What causes the cold temperatures that allow for PSCs to form?
What causes the cold temperatures that allow for MCs to form?}

Due to the upward flow in the summer hemisphere, and the adiabatic
cooling of the air, you get mesospheric clouds --- sometimes
called noctilucent clouds, or polar mesospheric clouds. The name "polar
meospheric cloud" should be avoided since these clouds have been
observed over Utah, which is certainly not the polar region. 

The clouds in the cold region of the lower stratosphere in the winter
hemisphere, where there is no sunlight, are called polar stratospheric
clouds [PSC].
