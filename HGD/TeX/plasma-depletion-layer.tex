\textbf{Why does the PDL only exist for Bz+ conditions?}

The plasma depletion layer [PDL] appears on the sunward side of the
magnetopause; it has a lower density, but a higher magnetic field, in
constrast to the upstream mangetosheat. This layer forms when no dayside
reconnection is occurring, which is often when the Bz component of the
interplanetary magnetic field is positive. When reconnection is not
occurring, the IMF tends to collect near the magnetopause; the PDL is
the result of pressure balancing to offset this build up of IMF.
