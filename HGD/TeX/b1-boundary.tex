 B1: equivalent to the instantaneous zero-energy Alfven boundary

 B1 is magnetically conjugate to the "electron plasma sheet boundary"

 * one might be cautious to map boundaries, e.g., one might be tempted
 to use a simple model to map ground or ionospheric observations of B1
 into the magnetosphere; in this case, the boundary might be thought to
 be at, say, $L=3$ in a dipole model, whereas spaceborne observations
 might actually show the electron plasma sheet to be near $L=6$; these
 important differences between a dipole model and a realistic/real
 mapping of B1 is caused by the inflationary effects of the ring current
 on magnetic fields near the magnetosphere's equatorial plane (see
 Tysganenko and Stern, 1996)
