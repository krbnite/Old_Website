* ideal MHD: fluid is regarded as a perfect electrical conductor
* ideal MHD: usually considered isentropic: Ds/Dt=0
* there is the "kinematic approximation" to ideal MHD which makes ideal MHD even
  ideal-ier: it prescribes a velocity field and assumes the magnetic field will
	not modify this field through the Lorentz force (hard to say when this approximation
	is believable...)

<CENTER><h2>Conservative Form </h2></CENTER>
<p>In addition to seemingly missing variables, one might be stumped occasionally
when seeing the MHD equations written in a way that seems alien. Of course, which presentation
of the equations looks alien 
depends on which book or set of notes you studied first. Above I wrote the equations
in non-conservative form. Many people do. Here I write the equations in conservative form.
Again, many people do. Know both. They're equivalent. It is just a matter of taste. What is
nice about the conservative form is that it emphasizes the nonlinear or tensorial nature
of some of the quantities.</p>
<p>Conservation laws are written in the following form (a la <a href="https://www.cfa.harvard.edu/~namurphy/Lectures/Ay253_02_ConservationLaws.pdf">slides</a> by Nick Murphy):
<CENTER>\(\partial_{t}(stuff)+\nabla\cdot(\)flux of stuff\()=0\)</CENTER>
<p>Source and sink terms, if any, would go on the right-hand side. If "stuff" is a scalar,
then the "flux of stuff" is a vector. If "stuff" is a vector, then the "flux of stuff" is a 
dyadic tensor. If this equation is satisfied for a quantity, then that quantity is locally 
conserved.</p><br/>

	<CENTER><h2>Eulerian Set vs Lagrangian Set</h2></CENTER>
	Above I mixed derivatives in the equations at my convenience. However, in fluid dynamics, one
	often finds the equations written using either the Lagrangian (convective view point) or the
	Eulerian (stationary view point) derivative in isolation. This is to emphasize the physical meaning
	of the equations set up in one reference frame or another. I think this possibly mucks up the equations
	since Faraday's law and the Maxwell-Ampere law are not typically written in a Lagrangian way.

	<p>To be clear:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Eulerian View: observer fixes eye on a volume element of space; parameters
		  are derived with respect to this location as fluid moves through it.</li>
		<li>Lagrangian View: observer fixes eye on a volume element of fluid, which
		  moves through space (this is the "fluid's point of view"); parameters are 
			derived with respect to this moving fluid element.  </li>

<CENTER><h2>Reduced Set </h2></CENTER>
<p>Oftentimes it appears as if the MHD equations are missing a few key variables. Specifically, 
	one might wonder what happened to the electric field, the current density, and sometimes
	even the pressure. These quantities have not disappeared! Given certain
	experimentally verifiable or reasonably applicable conditions, the number of independent
	variables in the full set of equations is reduced. One may still use the full set, but 
	it becomes easier and more tractable to reduce the set of equations by solving for some of
	the variables in terms of the other variables. At any stage then (usually at the end of any
	derivations), one may rewrite the full
	set of equations from the reduced set using the conditional equations prescribed at the 
	onset of the problem.</p>
	
	<p>There are a few conditions that are widely applicable in MHD applications: the low-frequency 
	approximation (changes in the electric field are small relative to other parameters of the plasma), 
	the inviscid fluid approximation (the plasma is nothing like molasses), and the adiabatic equation
  of state (the plasma 	
	is considered inviscid&mdash;that is, to have zero viscosity&mdash;and so the viscosity term in
	Newton's second law drops out.</p>

<h2>Plasma Regimes</h2>
Plasmas are extremely complex, so approximations are often made to study plasmas in simplified settings.
For a given set of approximations, a "plasma regime" is defined where those approximations hold valid.

<ul>
	<li>Unmagnetized Plasma: a plasma where there is no background magnetic field (i.e., no "guide field"); 
	for \(\mathbf{B}=\mathbf{B_{0}}+\mathbf{B_{1}}\), where \(\mathbf{B_{0}}\) is considered the
	equilibrium (or mean, or background) field, and \(\mathbf{B_{1}}\) is considered the magnetic
	fluctuations of the plasma, an unmagnetized plasma has \(\mathbf{B_{0}}=0\).
	</li>
	<li>Electrostatic Plasma: plasmas for which the assumption of no inductive electric fields
	is valid (that is, where \(\partial_{t}\mathbf{B} = -\nabla\times\mathbf{E} = 0\)).</li>
	<li>Low Frequency Approximation: assume that the displacement current in the Maxwell-Ampere
	law can be neglected (\(\partial_{t}\mathbf{E}/c^{2} \approx 0\)).
