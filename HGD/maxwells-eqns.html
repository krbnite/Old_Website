<h1>Reference: Maxwell's Equations (UNITS: MKS)</h1>
Maxwell's equations come in many forms, which can seem unrelated or alien to the newcomer. 
For example, one might 
see Faraday's law written for circuits one day, for magnetofluids the next, and then again 
in the context of general relativity. 

<p>Furthermore, although the equations are often written 
in the MKS system of units, they are just as frequently written in the CGS system of units,
resulting in similar looking equations with different coefficients (in the relativistic setting,
one might find other systems of units being employed as well, like the natural units). </p>

<p>Note that Maxwell's equations, in general (even the microscopic set), do not fully explain electromagnetic 
phenomena. They are but an approximation, despite being an overwhelmingly amazing approximation for most
applications. A refinement of Maxwell's equations comes from Quantum Electrodynamics. One might see 
the relevant QED equations referred to as Maxwell's equations from time to time; in this case, 
what is typically called
Maxwell's equations might then be referred to as the classical Maxwell equations. The QED 
equations are overkill for most applications since quantum deviations from the classical Maxwell equations
are very small on everyday application scales, but they are included on this page to be thorough.</p>

<p>The reference pages
on Maxwell's equations are simply meant to put a bunch of this stuff all on one place, and to give
some notes on how to convert one set into another set, etc. </p>

<p>This page looks at the differential (localized) formulation of Maxwell's equations.
For the ingegral (regional) forumulation, see <a href="">this page</a>.</p>

<p>This page does not look at QED, GR, or mathier representations (e.g., differential forms, geometric
algebra, etc) than vector calculus. 


<h2>Microscopic Media</h2>
<p>These equations are sometimes referred to as Maxwell's equations in vacuum, or more often than not just
"Maxwell's equations." They take into account the total charge and total current in a system, including
any and all of the shennanigans and complications at the atomic scale. This set of equations can 
theoretically be used for everything, although this would not be an easy way to do things (the "macroscopic"
equations given below define two auxillary fields that approximate the information resulting from the 
shennanigans and complications at the atomic level, reducing the complexity of the equation set).

<h2>Macroscopic Media</h2>
<p>The "mascropic Maxwell equations" are also known as "Maxwell's equations in matter." These reduce 
to the "microscopic Maxwell equations" (the more familiar form of Maxwell's equations) in a vacuum or a linear, isotropic material.</p>

<p>The macroscopic decompose the total charge and total current into free and bound charges and currents:
$$ \mathfrak{q} = \mathfrak{q}_{f}+\mathfrak{q}_{b} \\
\mathbf{j} = \mathbf{j}_{f}+\mathbf{j}_{b} $$ </p>
   
<p>This allows for easier computation of the dynamically evolving fields, but at the cost
   of introducing two auxillary fields \(\mathbf{D} and \mathbf{H}\), often called the 
	 "displacement field" and the "magnetizing field," respectively. Then, depending on the
	 material under study, phenomenological equations called the constitutive relations are
	 determined to relate the auxillary fields to the fundamental fields (often times, the 
	 fields are linearly related by a tensor, or even just a scalar).</p>

	 <p>The constitutive relations are empirical formulations of the auxillary fields.</p>

<h2>Gauge Field Representation</h2>

<h2>Wave Representation</h2>

<h2>Plane Wave Representation</h2>

<h2>Relationship to the integral formulation</h2>
In single variable calculus, you might have learned the fundamental theorem of calculus (hopefully). 
At one point, you may have also heard about Green's theorem on the plane. In vector calculus, you
might have learned of the divergence theorem. These are all really the same thing: instances of 
Stoke's theorem. (Lots of terms being thrown around here, but that's because history evolves from
many perspectives.)
