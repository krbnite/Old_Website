Bootstrap helps you deal with browser cross-compatibility. Usually with CSS,
you have to play games tricking various browsers to behave how you want them
to. Browsers these days come with anything that has a screen: different
devices, difference screen sizes, different software...

Bootstrap: one framework, every device. It will automatically scale for any
device, intelligently designing the proper layout, e.g., on a desktop you
might have multiple columns of text boxes, whereas on a mobile you will have
only one column.

Need the bootstrap <link> and the bootstrap <script> from a CDN. Also need
jQuery.


The edX course seems a bit lame. It focuses on using MS Visual Studio... And
it is slow going... I just want to know why I should use this or not.

This site seems to be cool:
